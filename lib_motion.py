    """
    Controls the robot movement.

    This class controls the robots movement by controlling the two Parallax Feedback 360Â° 
    High-Speed Servos `360_data_sheet`_ . The robots local coordinate system is defined in
    the following way. X-axis positive is straight forward, y-axis positive is perpendicular 
    to the x-axis in the direction to the left wheel. The center (0/0) is where the middle
    of the robots chassi is cutting across a imaginary line through both wheels/servos.
    Angle phi is the displacement of the local coordinate system to the real world 
    coordinate system. See :ref:`Used_local_coordinate_system` for a picture of it.

    .. warning::
        Be carefull with setting the min and max pulsewidth! Test carefully ``min_pw`` and ``max_pw``
        before setting them. Wrong values can damage the servo, see set_servo_pulsewidth_ !!!

    :param pigpio.pi pi:

    :param diameter_wheels:
        Diameter of both wheels. 
        **Default:** 66 mm, measured and taken from the products website `wheel_robot`_ .
    :param int unitsFC:

    :param float dcMax_r:
        Max duty cycle of the left wheel. 
        **Default:** 978.25,  measured with method :meth:`lib_para_360_servo.calibrate_pwm` , 
        see :ref:`Examples` .
    :param int l_wheel_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the feedback wire of the left servo has to be connected.
    :param int r_wheel_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the feedback wire of the right servo has to be connected.
    :param int servo_l_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the control wire of the left servo has to be connected.
    :param int min_pw_l:
        Min pulsewidth, see **Warning**, carefully test the value before!
        **Default:** 1280, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .

        **Default:** 1720, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .
    :param int min_speed_l:
        Min speed which the servo is able to move. **Default:** -1, so that

    :param int servo_r_gpio:
        GPIO identified by their Broadcom number, see elinux.org_ .
        To this GPIO the control wire of the right servo has to be connected.

        **Default:** 1280, taken from the data sheet `360_data_sheet`_ .
    :param int max_pw_r:

        the inner control loop. 
    :param float sampling_time:
        Sampling time of the four PID controllers in seconds.
        **Default:** 0.01.
        1. PWM of motor feedback is 910Hz (0,001098901 s), so position changes cannot 
        be recognized faster than 1.1 ms. Therefore, it is not needed to run the outer control 
        loop more often and update the speed values which have a 50 Hz (20ms) PWM.
        2. Tests of the runtime of the code including the controller part have shown that
        writing the pulsewidth (pi.set_servo_pulsewidth()) in :meth:`lib_para_360_servo.write_pwm.set_pw` is 
        the bottleneck which drastically slows down the code by the factor ~400 
        (0,002 seconds vs 0,000005 seconds; runtime with vs without writing pulsewidth).
        3. For recognizing the RPMs of the wheels 10ms is needed to have enough changes in the
        position. This was found out by testing. See method :meth:`move` for more informations.
    :param int,float Kp_p:
        Kp value of the outer PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.1.
    :param int,float Ki_p:
        Ki value of the outer PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.1.
    :param int,float Kd_p:
        Kd value of the outer PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.
    :param int,float Kp_s:
        Kp value of the inner PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.5.
    :param int,float Ki_s:
        Ki value of the inner PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.
    :param int,float Kd_s:
        Kd value of the inner PID controllers, see method :meth:`move` 
        for more informations.
        **Default:** 0.

        Core of motion control.

        This method controls the movement of the robot. It is called from :meth:`lib_motion.control.turn` 
        or :meth:`lib_motion.control.straight` and is not ment to be called directly. Four 
        digital PID controllers are used to make two cascade control loops, one cascade control loop
        for each wheel. Each cascade control loop has the same parameters (P/I/D parameters), so that 
        both wheels are controlled in the same way. Chosen default: Outer control loop is a PI 
        controller, inner control loop is a P controller. The outer loop is a position controller,
        the inner loop a speed controller. After both wheels have reached their set-point (position), 
        the method waits one second before the movement is marked as finished. This ensures that 
        overshoots/oscillations are possible and that both wheels can independently reach their
        set-point (position). The I part of each PID controller is limited to -1 and 1, so that 
        the sum of the errors is not integrated till infinity which means to very high or low values 
        which might cause problems. The output value of each inner PID controller is scaled between -1 
        and 1 and the output value of each outer PID controller is limited to -1 and 1.
        This ensures that no scaling factors are introduced in the P/I/D parameters and also that
        the output of each PID controller matches the speed range of the servos, defined in 
        :meth:`lib_para_360_servo.write_pwm.set_speed` . A sliding median window is used to filter out
        the noise in the rotation speed measurement (ticks/s) which is done indirectly by measuring the 
        position of the servo. Also a deadband filter after the error calculation of the outer control
        loop is implemented. This adjustments help to make the controllers more stable, e.g. filter out
        outliers while calculating the rotation speed and therefore avoid high value changes/jumps or
        avoid oscillations after reaching the set-point (position). The sample time of the digital PID
        controllers can also be freely chosen and does not influence the P/I/D parameters, the rotation
        speed measurement or the time before the movement is marked as finished.
